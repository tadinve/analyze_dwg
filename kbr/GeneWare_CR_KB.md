PCO Category: **Field Condition**
Dear Chris:
We are pleased to present you with R&S PCO 80576 in the amount of $47,834.00. This work is for GBI - North
Sidewalk Out-of-Sequence Work.
The scope of work is as follows:
The entire north side of the project was originally planned to be demoed in one high production activity. At
this point, the scope is chopped out to different activities and per field walk on 06/24/2019, grading a flat area
5 feet from the end of the building and sloping away 10' from the hinge point is required.
This PCO covers GBI original production credit which was to cut adjacent areas to provide fill to grade the
entire north side with a scraper. The new out-of-sequence work requires loading from the south stockpile and
trucking material for soil placement and because of access, the work will be performed with an excavator, pad
drum, skip loader, and added trucking to haul.
If you have any questions, or if I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me.
Yours sincerely,
