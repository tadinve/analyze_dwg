## Review Status: **REJECTED — Resubmit Required**

### Reasons for Rejection

1. **Non-Compliance with Specification 13 21 00**
   - Submitted panels do not meet the minimum ISO Class 5 cleanroom rating specified in Section 13 21 00.3.1.
   - Fire rating documentation is incomplete. Panels must have a minimum 2-hour fire rating per contract requirements.

2. **Missing Technical Data**
   - No manufacturer certifications provided for:
     - ASHRAE 52.2 filter efficiency
     - UL fire rating test reports
     - NFPA 90A compliance documentation
   - Thermal performance data (R-value) not included.

3. **Product Substitution Without Approval**
   - Submitted product is "CleanWall 2000" by XYZ Corp, which is **not** an approved equal to the specified "ModClean Pro" system.
   - No substitution request (via RFI or formal request) was submitted prior to this submittal.

4. **Incomplete Shop Drawings**
   - Wall panel connection details at ceiling interface are missing.
   - Seismic bracing details do not match approved structural drawings (Drawing S-301).
   - No electrical chase/penetration details provided for cleanroom lighting integration.

5. **Contract Coordination Issues**
   - Submitted schedule conflicts with approved construction schedule (Activity ID: CR-WALL-INSTALL).
   - Lead time of 16 weeks exceeds the 12-week window allocated in the master schedule.

- **Substitution Cost Impact (if approved):** TBD — requires cost comparison analysis if "CleanWall 2000" substitution is formally requested.
- **No entitlement for delay costs** if caused by late/incomplete submittals per Contract Section 4.3.2.

## Coordination Notes

- **Architect:** Copy to design team for review of any substitution requests.
- **MEP Coordination:** Electrical penetration details must be coordinated with Electrical Subcontractor (DEF Electric) before resubmittal.
- **Fire Marshal:** Fire rating documentation will be forwarded to local AHJ for pre-approval.
