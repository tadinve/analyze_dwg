### 🟥 1. Material Mismatch Against Specification

**Spec Reference:**  
**Spec 26 05 36 — Cable Tray Systems, Article 2.1 (CT-1 Steel Requirements)**

| Specification Requirement | Submittal Rev 2 | Status |
|---------------------------|----------------|--------|
| Hot-Dip Galvanized Steel (ASTM A123) | Aluminum 6063-T6 | ❌ |
| Load Capacity ≥ 75 lb/ft | 50 lb/ft | ❌ |
| Span = 12 ft | 8 ft | ❌ |
| Acceptable as EGC | Not acceptable as EGC | ❌ |

**Conclusion:**  
CT-1 aluminum does **not meet any** of the CT-1 steel requirements.  
**→ Automatic rejection.**

---

### 🟥 2. Drawing Conflict — Tray Type Does Not Match E-401

**Drawing Reference:**  
**E-401 — Industrial Tray Routing (Rooms C-17 and C-19)**

- Drawings mark **CT-1 Steel** for rooms C-17, C-19 and MER riser.
- **Submittal Rev 2 proposes Aluminum CT-2** for those CT-1 locations.

**Conclusion:**  
The submittal **directly contradicts the design drawings**.  
A substitution requires **ASI or DRB**, but **none exist**.

---

### 🟥 3. RFI-112 Still Open — Approval Cannot Proceed

**RFI Reference:** `RFI-112 — Request to Substitute Aluminum for Steel in CT-1 Zones`

- Status: **OPEN**
- No engineer response yet
- No fire/structural load analysis completed

**Submittal Issue:**  
Rev 2 attempts to **pre-empt the RFI process**.

**Conclusion:**  
No substitution may be considered until **RFI-112 receives a formal response**.

### 🟥 4. Meeting Minutes Misinterpreted — No Approval Was Issued

**Meeting Minutes Reference:**  
_Workgroup Meeting — Week 37 (2025-06-28)_

> “I’m not opposed to aluminum **as long as Mark and the EOR approve it**.” — Priya Shah

This was a **conditional statement**, not approval:

| Requirement | Status |
|------------|--------|
| EOR approval issued | ❌ |
| ASI or DRB issued | ❌ |
| Project documents updated | ❌ |

**Submittal Issue:**  
Rev 2 **incorrectly claims aluminum was accepted** based on the discussion.

**Conclusion:**  
DocLabs flags this as **misleading justification** and recommends **rejection**.
